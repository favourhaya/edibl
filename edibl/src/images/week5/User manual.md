After clicking the “Add food” button in the homepage you are taken to the barcode scanner screen. Upon the very first use of the barcode scanner you are presented with an alert which asks for camera permissions. You can then make the choice of whether you want to add foods manually or with the barcode scanner. The barcode scanner is the automatic choice, but if manual entry is preferred you can press the “manual entry” button below the barcode scanner box.

**4.1 With barcode scanner**  
 After accepting the permissions you are greeted with a camera view and a small box. The box is used as an outline for scanning the barcode of items. To scan a barcode, face the camera to the barcode and align it with the box. Once the camera focuses correctly on the barcode it can then be read by the scanner. The orientation of the barcode does not matter, the lighting also shouldn't be a problem as the phone detects low light situations and turns on the flash as needed. Once the barcode has been successfully read by the scanner you will be presented with a form which will require you to fill out certain information about the newly added item you have scanned. If the item is found within our food database, its information will be automatically inputted, all that's left to be input is the expiration date along with the storage location. The expiration date should be inputted using the Gregorian calendar, ie: day-month-year, along with hyphens. The storage location can be only one of three, being the pantry, fridge and freezer. If the item is not found in the database you will be prompted to complete the manual entry form for the item.

**4.2 Manual entry**  
After pressing the “manual entry” button you will be presented with a form which will require you to enter various information about the item you wish to add. Firstly enter the name of the item. Secondly choose one of the listed categories which suits the item best. Thirdly fill out the expiration date found on the item using the Gregorian calendar and using hyphens. Fourthly, select the storage location of the item, choose between the pantry(normal room temperature), fridge and freezer.

After filling out all of the required information(regardless of manual or barcode entry), press the “submit” button to add the item to your pantry. If all of the provided information is correctly entered your item will be saved. If any of the fields is entered incorrectly you will be unable to submit the item and will be prompted to resolve whichever issues arose within the form.
